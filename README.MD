Hi! Welcome to my Portfolio page where I'll throw my updated projects that I complete down the road. Here I can say I've learned the most and feel like I've mastered HTML/CSS. A lot of challenges came my way such as refactoring the page so I can scroll through it and make room for future projects! On the page you should be presented with an image of me super big and shiny! With a header navigational bar on top that'll direct you to a specific point. Then you're able to interact with the 'Contact Me' label button I created. Another feature worth mentioning is also clicking on my deployed project's image to go straight to it!
